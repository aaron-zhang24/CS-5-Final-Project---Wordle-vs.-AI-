# CS-5-Final-Project---Wordle-vs.-AI-
Can you beat the AI at Wordle? We shall see!

In our final project we recreated the game wordle as a text game that can be ran through the teraminal. We used the colorama library to help give the user whether if their word's letter was wrong(red), in the word(yellow), or in the correct position(green). While the game is being ran you are facing an AI and is competing to see who guesses the word first. This AI is essentially a wordle solver and most of the time it will beat the human before the human is able to guess the word correctly. We used what we learned throughout CS5 to build this project from the ground up.
